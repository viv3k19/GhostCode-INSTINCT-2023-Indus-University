# GhostCode: A Web-Based Memory and Puzzle Code Game
**GhostCode is a thrilling game developed for the Indus University Instinct 2023 event. It challenges participants to solve code puzzles within a limited time frame and advance through multiple rounds. The game features a personalized login system, a ghost-themed user interface, and a competitive final round to determine the ultimate winner.**

## Gameplay
* Start the game by pressing the "Start" button on the screen.
* The game presents a ghost-themed UI with 9 cards to flip.
* Each card contains a small code snippet.
* Participants must flip the cards and remember or copy the code snippets.
* The goal is to reconstruct the master code using the code snippets from all 9 cards.
* Participants have a time limit of 120 seconds to complete the task.
* A flip counter tracks the number of flips made by the participant.
* Be cautious as page refreshes are restricted. Refreshing the page will result in the game ending.
